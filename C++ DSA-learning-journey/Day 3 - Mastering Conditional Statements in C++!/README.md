# Day 3: Conditional Statements in C++ 🚦

Welcome to Day 3 of my C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey! Today, I focused on understanding conditional statements in C++, including `if`, `else if`, and nested `if` statements, which are essential for decision-making in programs.

## 📝 Overview

### Key Concepts:
- Introduction to `if-else` statements.
- Using `else if` for multiple conditions.
- Implementing nested `if-else` for complex decision-making.

### Topics Covered:
- **Basic `if-else`:** Checking conditions and executing code blocks based on those conditions.
- **`else if` Ladder:** Handling multiple conditions with sequential checks.
- **Nested `if-else`:** Making decisions within decisions by nesting `if-else` statements.

## 📘 Explanation

- **Basic `if-else`:** 
  - The `if` statement checks a condition (e.g., if `age >= 18`). If true, it executes the code inside the block. If false, it executes the code inside the `else` block.
  
- **`else if` Ladder:** 
  - The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. Each condition is evaluated in order, and the first true condition's block is executed.
  
- **Nested `if-else`:**
  - A more complex decision-making structure where an `if-else` statement is placed inside another `if-else` block. This allows for more nuanced decisions based on multiple criteria.

### 🚀 What I Learned:
- How to implement conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else` in C++.
- The use of `else if` to handle multiple conditions.
- How to use nested `if-else` to make more complex decisions based on several factors.

## 💡 Reflections

Today's practice with conditional statements reinforced how essential decision-making logic is in programming. These constructs allow for flexible and powerful code that can react to different inputs in diverse ways.

# Day 1: Introduction to C++ 🚀

Welcome to Day 1 of my C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey! Today, I focused on setting up the general skeleton for a basic C++ program and explored fundamental input/output operations.

## 📝 Overview

### Key Concepts:
- Setting up a C++ program skeleton.
- Understanding basic input/output in C++.

### Topics Covered:
- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: A quick way to import all standard C++ libraries.
- `#include <iostream>`: Essential for input/output stream handling.
- `int main()`: The entry point of any C++ program.
- `cout` and `cin`: Basic output and input in C++.

## 📂 Code Example

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> // Used to import all libraries
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Output a message to the console
    cout << "Sandy!" << "\n"; // or use endl for a newline

    // Taking input from the user
    cout << "Input/Output: " << endl;
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    
    // Displaying the input values
    cout << "Value of x: " << x << endl;
    cout << "Value of x: " << x << " and y: " << y;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## 📘 Explanation

- **Program Skeleton:**
  - Every C++ program starts with `#include <iostream>`, which allows us to use `cout` and `cin` for output and input.
  - The `main()` function is the starting point of the program, and it must return an integer value.
  
- **Input/Output Operations:**
  - `cout`: Used to print output to the console.
  - `cin`: Used to take input from the user.

### 🚀 What I Learned:
- How to set up and write a basic C++ program.
- The importance of including necessary headers for input and output operations.
- How to take user inputs and display them using `cin` and `cout`.

## 💡 Reflections

Starting with the basics is essential for building a strong foundation. Understanding how to set up a C++ program and manage input/output operations is crucial for more complex programming tasks.

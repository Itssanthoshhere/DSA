# Day 6: Loops in C++ 🔄

Welcome to Day 6 of my C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey! Today, I explored loops in C++, which are essential for executing repetitive tasks efficiently.

## 📝 Overview

### Key Concepts:
- Understanding the `for` loop and its usage in C++.
- Learning different ways to increment/decrement loop variables.
- Practicing various loop structures to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

### Topics Covered:
- **Basic `for` Loop:** Iterating over a fixed range.
- **Reverse `for` Loop:** Decrementing the loop variable.
- **Incrementing by Steps:** Looping with custom increments.

## 📂 Code Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    // Basic for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        cout << "Santhosh " << endl;
    }
    cout << "Final value of i: " << i << endl;
    
    // Reverse for loop
    for (int i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
        cout << "Santhosh " << i << endl;
    }
    cout << "Final value of i: " << i << endl;
    
    // Incrementing by steps
    for (int i = 1; i <= 25; i += 5) {
        cout << "Santhosh " << i << endl;
    }
    cout << "Final value of i: " << i << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## 📘 Explanation

- **Basic `for` Loop:**
  - The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. In the first example, the loop runs 10 times, printing "Santhosh" each time.

- **Reverse `for` Loop:**
  - The reverse `for` loop decreases the loop variable with each iteration. Here, the loop starts from 5 and decrements until it reaches 1, printing "Santhosh" and the current value of `i`.

- **Incrementing by Steps:**
  - This loop demonstrates how you can increment the loop variable by a value other than 1. The loop starts at 1 and increments by 5 each time, stopping when it exceeds 25.

### 🚀 What I Learned:
- How to control loop iterations with different conditions.
- The importance of the loop variable's starting point, condition, and increment/decrement in determining loop behavior.
- How to apply loops to solve repetitive problems efficiently.

## 💡 Reflections

Understanding loops is a fundamental aspect of programming. Loops allow us to automate repetitive tasks, making our code more efficient and concise. Mastering loops is crucial as they form the backbone of many algorithms and operations in programming.

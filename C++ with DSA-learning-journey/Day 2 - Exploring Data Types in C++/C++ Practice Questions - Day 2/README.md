# Day 2: Continuing the Learning Journey of Data Types in C++

## üìö Today's Practice Question

### Problem: Data Type Size
*Platform:* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

**Description:**

Geek is learning a new programming language. As data type forms the most fundamental part of a language, Geek is learning them with focus and needs your help. Given a data type, help Geek in finding the size of it in bytes.

**Data Types:**
- Character
- Integer
- Long
- Float
- Double

**Examples:**

1. **Input:** `Character`  
   **Output:** `1`  
   **Explanation:** For Java, it would be 2 bytes.

2. **Input:** `Integer`  
   **Output:** `4`

**Your Task:**

Complete the function `dataTypeSize()` which takes a string as input and returns the size of the data type in bytes.

### üõ† Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dataTypeSize(string str) {
        if (str == "Character") {
            return 1;  // Size of char in C++
        } else if (str == "Integer") {
            return 4;  // Size of int in C++
        } else if (str == "Long") {
            return sizeof(long);  // Size of long, typically 4 or 8 bytes
        } else if (str == "Float") {
            return 4;  // Size of float in C++
        } else if (str == "Double") {
            return 8;  // Size of double in C++
        } else {
            return -1;  // Return -1 for unknown data types
        }
    }
};
```

### üöÄ What I Learned

- Practiced identifying and returning the size of different data types in C++.
- Reinforced understanding of basic data types and their memory allocation.

## 🔍 Overview

Today’s focus was on understanding **Time and Space Complexity**, crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. We explored how to analyze and simplify complexity to ensure our code runs optimally even with large inputs.

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **Time Complexity:** Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes relative to the input size. Expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(N), O(N²)).
- **Space Complexity:** Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. Includes both input space and auxiliary space.

### Rules for Calculating Time Complexity
1. **Consider the Worst Case:** Analyze the worst-case scenario for upper-bound estimates.
2. **Ignore Constants:** Simplify expressions by ignoring constant factors.
3. **Avoid Lower Values:** Focus on the term that grows fastest as input size increases.

## 💻 Code Examples

### Time Complexity of a Simple Loop

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to demonstrate time complexity of O(N)
void printNumbers(int N) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) { // Loop runs N times
        cout << i << " "; // Constant time operation
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int N = 5;
    // Call function to print numbers
    printNumbers(N);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `printNumbers` function has a time complexity of O(N) because the loop runs N times, each involving a constant-time operation.

### Nested Loops and Time Complexity

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to demonstrate time complexity of O(N^2)
void printPairs(int N) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {      // Outer loop runs N times
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {  // Inner loop runs N times
            cout << "(" << i << ", " << j << ") "; // Constant time operation
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int N = 3;
    // Call function to print pairs
    printPairs(N);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `printPairs` function has a time complexity of O(N²) due to the nested loops, each running N times.

### Space Complexity Example with an Array

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function that uses an array to demonstrate space complexity
void arrayExample(int N) {
    int arr[N]; // Array takes O(N) space
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        arr[i] = i; // Constant time operation
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " "; // Print array elements
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int N = 5;
    // Call function to work with an array
    arrayExample(N);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `arrayExample` function has a space complexity of O(N) due to the array of size N that it creates.

## 🔧 Challenges Faced

- Simplifying complex time complexity expressions into Big O notation.
- Differentiating between time and space complexity and understanding optimization strategies for both.

## 💡 Reflections

Understanding time and space complexity is fundamental for writing efficient algorithms. This knowledge is especially crucial for competitive programming, where optimizing performance is key to handling large datasets and meeting strict time limits.

# Exploring Pattern-10: Half Diamond Star Pattern in C++ 🌟

Welcome to Day 19 of my C++ journey! Today, I tackled the **Half Diamond Star Pattern**, a simple yet fascinating pattern that enhances your understanding of symmetry in pattern programming. This is part of my continuous learning process in mastering nested loops and pattern generation in C++.

## 📝 Overview

### Key Concepts:
- Working with **nested loops** to create patterns.
- Understanding **symmetry** in pattern design.
- Building on **control flow** logic with conditional loops.

### Topics Covered:
- **Nested Loops**: Learning to use nested loops to generate increasing and decreasing star patterns.
- **Pattern Design**: Constructing a half-diamond-shaped star pattern.
- **Input/Output**: Taking user input to determine the size of the half-diamond pattern and outputting the result in the required format.

## 📂 Code Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void nStarTriangle(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 2 * n - 1; i++) {
        int stars = i;
        if (i > n) {
            stars = 2 * n - i;
        }
        // Print stars for the current row
        for (int j = 1; j <= stars; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    cout << "Half Diamond Star Pattern\n";
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    nStarTriangle(n);
    return 0;
}
```

## 📘 Explanation

- **Pattern Function (nStarTriangle)**:
  - This function prints a half diamond pattern based on the input value `n`.
  - The **outer loop** runs `2*n-1` times to create rows for both the upper and lower parts of the half-diamond.
  - The **inner loop** prints the correct number of stars per row. For rows after the middle point, it decreases the number of stars to maintain the half-diamond shape.

- **Main Function**:
  - The program prompts the user to input a value `n`.
  - It then calls the `nStarTriangle(n)` function to print the pattern based on the input value.

### 🚀 What I Learned:
- Using nested loops to create patterns that follow symmetry rules.
- Understanding how to manipulate loops to print increasing and decreasing star patterns.
- Handling conditional logic inside loops to control the flow and structure of the pattern.

## 💡 Reflections

Today's exercise in pattern programming helped me strengthen my understanding of loop structures and conditional flow. The **Half Diamond Star Pattern** is not only visually appealing but also provides an excellent way to grasp the concepts of nested loops and how they can be used to generate complex shapes.

# Exploring Pattern-11: Binary Number Triangle in C++ 🌟

Welcome to Day 20 of my C++ journey! Today, I dived deeper into pattern programming by exploring the **Binary Number Triangle Pattern**. This pattern alternates between 0s and 1s in a triangular form, helping me sharpen my logical skills with alternating sequences.

## 📝 Overview

### Key Concepts:
- Pattern programming with alternating binary numbers.
- Utilizing nested loops to manage alternating outputs across rows.
- Controlling starting values based on row indices (odd/even).

### Topics Covered:
- **Nested Loops**: Understanding how loops control the row count and number placement.
- **Binary Alternation**: Using conditional logic to alternate between 0 and 1 in each row.
- **Input/Output**: Handling user input to determine the number of rows and printing the alternating binary triangle.

## 📂 Code Example

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void pattern11(int n) {
    int start = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            start = 1;
        }
        else {
            start = 0;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            cout << start << " ";
            start = 1 - start;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    
    cout << "Pattern - 11: Binary Number Triangle Pattern" << endl;
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    cout << "\n";
    pattern11(n);
}

```

## 📘 Explanation

- **Pattern Function (pattern11)**:
  - The function `pattern11(int n)` prints a binary triangle, where the starting value alternates between 1 and 0 for odd and even rows.
  - The outer loop (`for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)`) controls the number of rows.
  - The inner loop prints alternating binary numbers for each row based on the current starting value.
  - The expression `start = 1 - start;` is used to toggle between 0 and 1 after each print.

- **Main Function**:
  - The program begins by prompting the user for an input value `n`, which represents the number of rows.
  - It then calls the `pattern11(n)` function to print the binary triangle pattern.

### 🚀 What I Learned:
- How to alternate values in a pattern using a combination of loops and conditionals.
- The importance of controlling loop counters and starting values for dynamic patterns.
- Enhanced understanding of row-wise and column-wise logic in pattern programming.

## 💡 Reflections

Creating binary number patterns was a fun challenge! It further reinforced my knowledge of loops and conditionals in C++. This type of pattern helped me think creatively about alternating sequences and how to manage them efficiently in code. The logic of alternating 0s and 1s and deciding the starting point for each row was an interesting aspect of this task.
